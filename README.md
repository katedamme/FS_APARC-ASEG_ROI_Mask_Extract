# FS_APARC-ASEG_ROI_Mask_Extract
# These are just a couple of handy utilities that take all FreeSurfer labels and iterate through the FreeSurfer LookUpTable and makes all relevant masks
# NOTE: this depends on scripts already built by Freesurfer (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FreeSurferWiki) and standard tcsh
# This was created via a collaboration with Ajay Nadig and Katherine SF Damme at Northwestern University in 2016
